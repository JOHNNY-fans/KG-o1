His name is nowhere mentioned by his contemporaries. He frequently plays in his verse on the word \"Rutebeuf\", which was a \"nom de plume\", and is variously explained by him as derived from \"rude boeuf\" and \"rude oeuvre\" (\"coarse ox\" or \"rustic piece of work\"). Paulin Paris thought that he began life in the lowest rank of the minstrel profession as a \"jongleur\" (juggler and musician). Some of his poems have autobiographical value. In \"Le Mariage de Rutebeuf\" (\"The Marriage of Rutebeuf\") he says that on the 2 January 1261 he married a woman old and ugly, with neither dowry nor amiability. In the \"Complainte de Rutebeuf\" he details a series of misfortunes which have reduced him to abject destitution. In these circumstances he addresses himself to Alphonse, comte de Poitiers, brother of Louis IX, for relief. Other poems in the same vein reveal that his own miserable circumstances were chiefly due to a love of play, particularly a game played with dice; which was known as griesche. It would seem that his distress could not be due to lack of patrons; for his metrical \"Life of Saint Elizabeth of Hungary\" was written by request of Erard de Valery, who wished to present it to Isabel, queen of Navarre; and he wrote elegies on the deaths of Anceau de l'Isle Adam, the third of the name, who died about 1251, Eudes, comte de Nevers (died 1267), Theobald II of Navarre (died 1270), and Alphonse, comte de Poitiers (d. 1271), which were probably paid for by the families of the personages celebrated.

Swell wavelength, also, varies from event to event. Occasionally, swells which are longer than 700 m occur as a result of the most severe storms. Swells have a narrower range of frequencies and directions than locally generated wind waves, because swell waves have dispersed from their generation area, have dissipated and therefore lost an amount of randomness, taking on a more defined shape and direction.

He was at the first mission station, Killalpaninna (often referred to as Bethesda), from 1892 to 1894, and the second, Hermannsburg, eighty miles west of Alice Springs, from 1894 to 1922, first as teacher and, from 1901 onwards, manager, and it is for his work here that he is mostly known today. Strehlow was ably assisted and supported by his wife Friederike Johanna Henriette Keysser (31 August 1875 \u2013 30 April 1957), who played the central role in reducing the high infant mortality which threatened Aboriginal communities all over Australia after the onset of white settlement. It is probable that Hermannsburg was the only Mission in Australia at the start of the twentieth century where the population was growing through natural increase. As a polymath with an interest in natural history, through his Aranda informants Strehlow provided plant and animal specimens to museums in Germany and Australia, a number of which first came to scientific notice through his collecting. This was the outcome of his collaboration with Moritz, Baron von Leonhardi of Gross Karben in Hessen, Germany, who also suggested he write his monumental anthropological work Die Aranda- und Loritja-St\u00e4mme in Zentral-Australien (The Aranda and Loritja Tribes in Central Australia). With Leonhardi as editor this work became the first publication of the newly founded St\u00e4dtisches V\u00f6lkermuseum (Municipal Ethnological Museum) of Frankfurt am Main, appearing in eight parts between 1907 and 1920. Strehlow sent what was said to be the best collection in the world of Aboriginal artefacts \u2013 both sacred and secular \u2013 to Frankfurt, unfortunately largely destroyed in the bombing of the city in World War Two, though some fine pieces remain. Due to Leonhardi\u2019s sudden death in 1910, Strehlow\u2019s linguistic researches intended as part of Die Aranda- und Loritja-St\u00e4mme were never published, though used in manuscript form by his son Theodor George Henry Strehlow and later Hermannsburg missionaries. Strehlow also collaborated on the pioneering first complete translation of the New Testament into an Aboriginal language (Dieri), published by the British and Foreign Bible Society in 1897, and he later translated the New Testament into Aranda, parts of which were published after his death. He also produced a reader and service book in the latter language. Falling ill with dropsy in September 1922, he tried to reach a doctor but died at Horseshoe Bend halfway between Alice Springs and Oodnadatta, leaving Frieda and fourteen-year-old son Theodor to continue south to Adelaide without him.
