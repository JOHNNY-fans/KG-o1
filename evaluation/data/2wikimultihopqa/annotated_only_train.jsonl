Maria Alexandrovna learned the Russian language quickly; she was pious and identified with her adopted country. She did not enjoy court life or the duties of representation as she was shy and of a withdrawn nature. As a consequence she was not popular. She took a more focused interest in charitable activities after the death of her mother-in-law the Dowager Empress Alexandra Feodorovna in 1860. Maria Alexandrovna was particularly active in the field of female education, establishing Russia's first all female schools. She organized the Russian Red Cross and expanded its activities during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877\u201378. She was deeply affected by the death of her eldest son the Tsarevich Nicholas Alexandrovich in 1865. By then, her fragile constitution was undermined by her numerous pregnancies and by tuberculosis which afflicted her since 1863. To avoid the harsh Russian winters, she spent long sojourns in the Crimea and in southern Europe. During many summers she visited her family in Jugenheim, where she had spent her childhood. Her marriage to Tsar Alexander II started as a love match and it was happy for some years, but Alexander II had many affairs and in 1866 he fell in love with Catherine Dolgorukova and had four children with his mistress. Maria Alexandrovna was treated with respect by her philanderer husband and she was much loved by her surviving children. After a long illness, she died in 1880. The Mariinsky Theatre in Saint Petersburg, the city of Mariinsk in Kemerovo Oblast, and the city of Mariehamn in \u00c5land are named after her."}], "sub_question_answer": ["What is the cause of death of Maria Alexandrovna?", "tuberculosis"], "titled_cot_sent": "Maria Alexandrovna died from tuberculosis {Source: Maria Alexandrovna (Marie of Hesse)}."}, {"cot_sent": "So the answer is: tuberculosis.", "marked_cot_sent": "So the answer is: tuberculosis.", "marked_titled_cot_sent": "So the answer is: tuberculosis.", "paragraphs": [{"supporting_snippet": null, "text_substring": null, "title": null, "paragraph_text": null}], "sub_question_answer": null, "titled_cot_sent": "So the answer is: tuberculosis."}]}
